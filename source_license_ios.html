                    no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent <br>
                    license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer<br> 
                    the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such <br>
                    Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by <br>
                    combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was<br> 
                    submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a <br>
                    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution<br> 
                    incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, <br>
                    then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall <br>
                    terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>

                    claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or <br>
                    additional liability.<br>

                          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br><br>
                          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br><br>
                          the Derivative Works; and<br><br>

                          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>
                          as modifying the License.<br>

                      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>
                      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>
                      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>
                      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>
                      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>
                      the conditions stated in this License.<br>

                      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br>

                   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>
                      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>

                   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>
                      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>
                      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>
                      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>
                      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>
                      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>
                      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>
                      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>
                      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>
                      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>
                      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
                <br>
                   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>
                      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>
                      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>
                      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>
                      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>
                      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>
                      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>
                      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>
                      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>
                      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br>

                          or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>
                          granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>
                          as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>

                    <br>
                          (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br>

                          (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br>
                              that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>

                              excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>

                              distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>
                              include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>
                              within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>
                              pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>

                              wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>
                              of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>
                              do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>
                              notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>
                              or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>
                              that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>
                              as modifying the License.<br>

                          You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>
                          may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>
                          for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>
                          for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>
                          reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>
                          the conditions stated in this License.<br>

                       5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>
                          any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>
                          by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>
                          this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>
                          Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>
                          the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>
                          with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>

                       6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>
                          names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>
                          except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>
                          origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br>

                       7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>
                          agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>
                          Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS"" BASIS,<br>
                          WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>
                          implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>
                          of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>
                          PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>
                          appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>
                          risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br>

                       8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>
                          whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>
                          unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>
                          negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>
                          liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>
                          incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>
                          result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>
                          Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>
                          work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>
                          other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>
                          has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>

                       9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>
                          the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>
                          and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>
                          or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>
                          License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>
                          on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>
                          of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>
                          defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>
                          incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>
                          of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br>

                             this License; and b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and<br>
                             c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and <br>
                            attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the <br>
                            Derivative Works; and d) If the Work includes a “NOTICE” text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works <br>
                            that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding <br>
                            those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a <br>
                            NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along <br>
                            with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices<br>
                             normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may<br>
                             add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE <br>
                            text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may <br>
                            add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>
                             for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your <br>
                            use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License. 5. <br>
                            Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion <br>
                            in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or<br>
                             conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement<br>
                             you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions. 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to<br>
                             use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and<br>
                             customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file. 7. Disclaimer of<br>
                             Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor <br>
                            provides its Contributions) on an “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,<br>
                             including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A <br>

                             assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License. 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event<br>
                             and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable<br>
                             law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for<br>
                             damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result<br>
                             of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>
                             work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such <br>
                            Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While <br>
                            redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance <br>
                            of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. <br>
                            However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole <br>
                            responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, <br>
                            and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, <br>
                            such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability. END OF TERMS <br>
